# Implementation Plan & Report Writing Guidelines

This document defines **how to write Implementation Plans and Reports** using the adopted templates.

The primary goal is:

> **A future reader (AI or human) must be able to quickly understand:**
> - What is already done
> - What is NOT done
> - What should be done next (if anything)

## General Writing Principles

task_id = YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-(random 6 characters such as a1f45t)

If your plan is just some minor changes, additions, or removals, follow template_note.md and save it inside devlog folder.

In this case, name file as <task_id>_note.md.

If your plan is complex, follow template_plan.md and template_report.md and save those inside devlog folder.

In this case, name file as <task_id>_plan.md and <task_id>_report.md.

You can add any other files in devlog folder if it donsn't fit well into those templates, with cautions.
